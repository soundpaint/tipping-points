# Downloads

For executing the pre-compiled JAR file of the Tipping Point App, you
need to have installed a Java Runtime Environment (JRE), version 8 or
later, on your host computer.  You can download a current version of
the JRE, if not already installed, from the website [Java SE Runtime
Environment 8 -
Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html),
and then install it.

The following pre-compiled release versions are available:

* [Tipping Points App v0.1](/releases/TippingPoints_v0_1.jar)

Developers may want to compile the app by themselves.  To do so, you
need the Java Development Kit (JDK) of version 8 or later.  The Java
source files are available on the [GitHub
Repository](https://github.com/soundpaint/tipping-points).
